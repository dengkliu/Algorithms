1. Successly implemented both articulation points (graph2) and strongest connected components (graph3)

2. For finding articulation points, compile and run gragh2. 
   The order of each vertex in deepth frist search and articulation 
   points for various numbers of vertices and edges will be printed out in the terminal.
   
3. For finding strongest connected components, compile and run graph3. 
   The order of each vertex in deepth frist search and the strongest 
   connected components will be printed out in the terminal.
